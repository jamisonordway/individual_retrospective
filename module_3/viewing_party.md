# Viewing Party Personal Retrospective

The projects you complete at Turing will help you build proficiency in many skills you will need on the job. They're are also extremely useful experiences to discuss in networking conversations and job interviews! Students and alumni who can confidently speak to their specific technical contributions and teamwork processes tend to be the most successful in the job hunt.

This takes practice. The prompts below are meant to mimic technical and behavioral questions you might be asked in interviews. 

### Instructions
